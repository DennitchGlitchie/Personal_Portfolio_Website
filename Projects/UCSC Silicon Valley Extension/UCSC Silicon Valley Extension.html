									<p>I am currently enrolled in a subset of classes required to receive an Embedded Systems Certification from the UC Santa Cruz Extension in Silicon Valley. Below are the classes that I am excited to be involved with.</p>
									<hr />
									<h2>(1) High Efficiency Switch-mode Power Supply, Design Overview</h2>
									<p>The power supply is a critical component in any system and has a major impact on overall reliability. System designers need to understand the designs and requirements of their power supplies to meet the evolving needs of the system, and to satisfy regulatory requirements for energy efficiency and standby power. This course covers both analog and digital switch-mode power supplies.</p>
									<p>This course starts by introducing the fundamental concepts of a real switch-mode power supply and its functions, operations and interactions. Discussions will cover the various topologies as they relate to power supply operation, design, component selection, and rating for a particular application. The course focuses on the most popular topology: the Flyback converter. The case study includes the clamp, snubber networks, transformer, and EMI filter. You will learn the design considerations for EMI, thermal management, and product safety with detailed discussions of PCB design. Lastly, the course discusses the challenges of power supply development in the face of evolving system requirements and regulations. You'll learn how to meet requirements of high efficiency, high power density, digital control and reporting, and stringent ultra-low no-load standby power. The course has expanded practical discussions of digital implementations of a real switch-mode power supply with added features, enhanced performance, and programmability.</p>
									<p>You'll gain practical power supply design knowledge and skills relevant to your hardware engineering environment and be able to satisfy actual market and regulatory requirements with practical component implementations. The course features live demonstrations and waveform observations of power supply behaviors using state-of-the-art solutions.</p>

									<h2>(2) The Internet of Things: Sensors, Platforms, Communications, and Applications</h2>
									<p>Internet of Things (IoT) is a fast-emerging area in the technology industry today, which has applications in a wide variety of domains including home automation, wearables, personal fitness, smart grid, smart irrigation, and smart parking. The total number of IoT devices is estimated to exceed 20 billion in the next several years. This course is intended for students who want to learn how to design and prototype IoT applications. It focuses on hardware choices, including sensors, actuators, and IoT platforms, the software required to interact with these sensors and actuators, the communication bearers available for moving the data to/from the sensors and the platform and getting it to a cloud platform. Upon completion of the course, one will be able to design and implement a complete end-to-end IoT solution from sensors through getting data into the cloud.</p>
									<p>The course emphasizes fundamental concepts such as transmission line analysis, slew rate, termination, etc. It introduces the basic IO logic, timing analysis and package model, and covers bit error rate, bi-directional IO and decision feedback filters. It does not cover complete circuit designs of the latest IO schemes or board design. Because most solutions are silicon-based, ESD (electro static discharge) concepts and techniques will also be discussed. A circuit simulation tool will be offered to students for exercises but its instruction is not part of the course.</p>

									<h2>(3) IO Design Fundamentals</h2>	
									<p>This course is an introduction to IO interfacing from one platform to another at both chip and board levels. With todayâ€™s chips running over 1GHz, inter-chip communicating is often a limiting factor of the system. Examples of high-speed IO are HDMI, USB 3.0, and 100Base-T.There is no single solution and over the years numerous approaches have been taken, including lowering logic voltages, using differential signals and optical interfaces. The course reviews the various approaches that have been taken in the last two decades, and covers the advantages and disadvantages of TTL, CMOS, low-voltage CMOS, LVDS and optical, from the perspective of speed, power, cost, and complexity.</p>
