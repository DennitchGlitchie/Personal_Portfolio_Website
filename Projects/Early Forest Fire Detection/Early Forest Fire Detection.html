									<h2>Summary:</h2>
									<p>This research was aimed to combat the $200 million in wildfire damages in California and damages all around the world. By placing smart-video sentries in remote and rural locations that are prone to wildfires, the ability to react quickly and prevent fire-spread is greatly enhanced. This study develops a reliable smoke-detection algorithm using Digital Image Processing and Computer Vision techniques on multi-spectral (visible & infrared) video. By utilizing Principal Component Analysis (PCA) followed by spatial filtering and an environment-tuned selective thresholding, the temporal variance of smoke can be accurately identified. Other topics such as spectral signature of smoke and spectral clustering are investigated. This study was used as culminating thesis project and defense to earn my MS in EE at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo. Early Forest Fire Detection via Principal Component Analysis of Spectral and Temporal Smoke Signature is archived in <a href="http://digitalcommons.calpoly.edu/theses/1456/">Digital Commons</a>.</p>

									<h2>Data Processing:</h2>
									<p>300 GB of sample video data captured the burning of various native fuels in a BBQ from 875 yards away. A series of Digital Image Processing techniques were performed to extract, enhance, and match the field of view of the visible and infrared images. These techniques were implemented through MATLAB scripts.</p>

									<h2>A Sample Image of the Fire Scene</h2>

									<p><span class="image left"><img src="Capture 1 2.jpeg" alt="" /></span>Here is the a sample of the drone's perspective of smoke in the fire scene. Infrared and visible cameras recorded data in sync with their own constant FOV at 875 yards from the burning fuel in a BBQ pit.  </p>

									<h2>Aligning Field of View of Visible and Infrared Data</h2>

									<p><span class="image left"><img src="Capture 2.png" alt="" /></span>The infrared and visible videos were processed to produce images with aligned field of views as they had similar but not unique perspectives on the fire-scene. This processing was scripted in MATLAB using an alignment transform. </p>

									<h2>Identifying Smoke from Temporal Signature:</h2>
									<p>A technique based on the Principal Component Transform was used in attempt to extract the unique temporal variance of smoke in a fire-scene. A Principal Component Transform is a statistical procedure that uses an orthogonal transformation to convert correlated images into linearly uncorrelated Principal Component Images. Smoke areas (or areas of strong temporal variance) upon visual inspection can be seen in the Principal Component Images as darker or lighter regions. Using an environment-calibrated thresholding method and post-processing, an algorithm based on Principal Component Analysis was developed to identify smoke in an image of a fire scene.</p>

									<h2>Principal Component Transform</h2>

									<p><span class="image left"><img src="Capture 4.jpeg" alt="" /></span>Using blurring and environment calibration, smoke in a scene can be identified from its Principal Component Images.</p>
									<p>.</p>
									<p>.</p>
									<p>.</p>

									<h2>Identifying Smoke</h2>
									
									<p><span class="image left"><img src="Capture 3.jpeg" alt="" /></span>Five chronological images in time are transformed to their five Principal Component Images in order to extract the unique temporal variance of smoke.  </p>
									<p>.</p>

									<h2>Smoke Identification Process</h2>
									
									<p><span class="image left"><img src="Flow Chart 2.jpeg" alt="" /></span>This block diagram explains the various transformation and image processing that will identify smoke in a set of temporal images. By utilizing principal component analysis (PCA) followed by spatial filtering and environment-tuned selective thresholding, the temporal variance of smoke can be accurately identified.</p>
									<p>.</p>

									<h2>Investigation of Spectral Smoke Signature: </h2>
									<p>Images were transformed into their feature space and analyzed critically to identify whether a "Spectral Smoke Signature" could be uniquely identified. Hue, saturation, and illumination were investigated with various types of cluster analysis including centroid-based, connectivity-based, and density-based clustering. It was determined that smoke in an image could not be easily identified solely by its spectral features. Moreover, infrared data proved to be ineffective here as smoke does not reflect infrared light. </p>

									<h2>Visible Spectral Signature</h2>
									<p>This data plot represents all pixels in a single image represented in the feature space. The black markers represent "smoke pixels" while the red markers make up the rest of the image. Notice that it is difficult to identify smoke purely by its "smoke signature" as the feature space is quite continuous.</p>

									<h2>Input Parameter Optimization and Machine Learning:</h2>
									<p>In order to optimize smoke identification results, effort was made to identify optimal input parameters  (i. e. number of images, image capture rate, principal component selection). A collection of "truth" images were made using photoshop to manually identify the smoke in an image. The plot above represents how well a given set of parameters performed when identifying smoke. By correlating the algorithm output to the truth images, the ideal input parameters could be identified. </p>

									<h2>Algorithm Parameter Optimization via Output Scoring</h2>
									<p>The block diagram above describes how algorithm outputs were "scored" against truth images. The 3-D scoring plot was generated by the conglomerated scores and parameter inputs</p>
